# Generative-Adversarial-Network

This repo includes code Examples for creating a simple letter (A-F) image generator, using Generative Adversarial Network (GANs).
Detailed information on implementation can be found here: https://ai-by-example.com/generative-adversarial-networks/

We train the code on letters A-F, below is a sample of the input data.
